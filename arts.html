				<h1>Andy Warhol Artworks</h1>
				<p>Andy Warhol was a leading figure in the Pop Art movement. Like his contemporaries Roy
					Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg, Warhol responded to mass-media culture of the 1960s. His
					silkscreens of cultural and consumer icons—including Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Campbell’s
					Soup Cans, and Brillo Boxes—would make him one of the most famous artists of his generation. “The
					best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do,” he once
					explained. Born Andrew Warhola on August 6, 1928 in Pittsburgh, PA, he graduated from the Carnegie
					Institute of Technology in 1949. Moving to New York to pursue a career in commercial illustration,
					the young artist worked for magazine such as Vogue and Glamour.

				<h2>Campbell's Soup</h2>
				<h3> 1962 </h3>
				<p>By the 1960s, the New York art world was in a rut, the very original and popular canvases of the
					Abstract Expressionists of the 1940s and '50s had become cliché. Warhol was one of the artists that
					felt the need to bring back imagery into his work. The gallery owner and interior designer Muriel
					Latow gave Warhol the idea of painting soup cans, when she suggested to him that he should paint
					objects that people use every day (it is rumored that Warhol ate the soup for lunch every single
					day). He painted Campbell's soup cans, Brillo boxes, and Coca-Cola bottles from 1962 onward.

					Warhol started his career and became an extremely successful consumer ad designer. Here, he used the
					techniques of his trade to create an image that is both easily recognizable, but also visually
					stimulating. Consumer goods and ad imagery were flooding the lives of Americans with the prosperity
					of that age and Warhol set out to subtly recreate that abundance, via images found in advertising.
					He recreated on canvas the experience of being in a supermarket. So, Warhol is credited with
					envisioning a new type of art that glorified (and also criticized) the consumption habits of his
					contemporaries and consumers today.</p>

				<h2>Coca-Cola 3</h2>
				<h3> 1962 </h3>
				<p>
					"I just paint things I always thought were beautiful, things you use every day and never think
					about." Warhol's statement epitomizes his ethos; his works put ordinary items front and center. This
					idea applies to the hand-painted portrait of a Coca-Cola bottle. Another challenge to the domination
					of Abstract Expressionism, Warhol's Coca-Cola is equal in size to many of the popular canvases of
					the time (6ft x 5ft) but is devoid of their abstractions. However, there are some other similarities
					here. As in Barnett Newman's popular Stations of the Cross series of works, Coca-Cola is comprised
					of a large, black mass on a white background. The bottle jumps out at the viewer; demanding the kind
					of attention Motherwell's profound canvases received - yet now the sense of irony reigns.

				<h2> Sleep </h2>
				<h3> 1963 </h3>
				<p>
					In the early 1960s, during a period of immense creativity, Warhol continued to challenge the status
					quo through a different medium, film. Over his career Warhol made over 650 films spanning a wide
					range of subjects. His films were lauded by the art world, and their influence is seen in
					performance art and expiremental filmmaking to this day. In 2013 the actress Tilda Swinton
					participated in an installation where she slept in a glass box at MoMA and the writer, actress, and
					director Lena Dunham recently expressed her desire to remake Warhol's Sleep shot for shot, but with
					herself as the subject.

					Sleep is one of the artist's earliest films and his first foray into durational film, a style that
					became one of his signatures. This six-hour movie is a detailed exploration of John Giorno sleeping.
					Warhol's lover at the time, the viewer sees Giorno through Warhol's eyes, a strip of Giorno's naked
					body is in every scene. Although this seems to be a series of continuous images, it is actually six
					one hundred foot rolls of film layered and spliced together, played on repeat. Repetition was at the
					heart of Warhol's oeuvre, as well as his fascination with the mundane. All people need to sleep;
					Warhol once again transformed banality into artistic expression.

					Empire and Eat succeeded Sleep in the canon of Warhol's duration films. Empire chronicles eight
					hours of the Empire State Building at dusk and Eat is a 45 minute film about a man eating a
					mushroom. Warhol's themes were as expansive as his filmography, delving into more explicit areas
					such as homosexuality and gay culture, such as Blowjob, a continuous shot of DeVeren Bookwalter's
					face while he receives oral sex from filmmaker Willard Maas, and Lonesome Cowboys, a raunchy
					western. His films are widely recognized as Pop masterpieces, enshrined in film institutes and
					modern art archives across the world.

				<h2> Brillo Boxes </h2>
				<h3> 1964 </h3>
				<p>
					Still using the silkscreen technique, this time on plywood, Warhol presented the viewer with exact
					replicas of commonly used products found in homes and supermarkets. This time, his art pieces are
					stackable, they are sculptures that can be arranged in various ways in the gallery - yet each box is
					exactly the same, one is no better than another. Rather than the series of slightly different
					paintings that have been made by many famous artists (think Monet's haystacks or cathedrals) Warhol
					makes the point that these products are all the same and (in his opinion) they are beautiful! Making
					these items in his "factory" Warhol again makes fun of (or brilliantly provokes) the art world and
					the artist-creator.

					With Brillo Boxes, Warhol also has a personal connection. Warhol was originally from Pittsburg -
					steel city, the commodity that made the city prosperous and later quite depressed. Brillo is steel
					wool, a product stereotypically used by housewives to keep cookware shining in their lovely American
					homes. Did Warhol like the product itself, think the store displays for the product ridiculous, or
					as a gay man, did he enjoy the contrast of steel and wool, in one friendly package?

				<h2> Mao </h2>
				<h3> 1973 </h3>
				<p>
					Warhol combines paint and silkscreen in this image of Mao Zedong, a series that he created in direct
					reaction to President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. Warhol took the black and white image of
					Mao from his Little Red Book (Mao's famous communist publication), and created hundreds of different
					sized canvases of the totalitarian ruler. Some of these paintings are as large as 15 feet x 10 feet,
					a scale evoking the dominating nature of Mao's rule over China and the awesome cult of personality
					Mao wielded. This monumental size also echoes the towering propagandistic representations that were
					being displayed throughout China during the Cultural Revolution. But by creating hundreds of such
					images, and lining them up on the wall, Warhol made the image of Mao into a supermarket product -
					like Coca-Cola bottles - lined up on the shelves (and available in small, medium, and large).
					Warhol's Mao is now a consumer product, a basic building block of capitalism - or the very idea that
					communism is against.

					Warhol goes even further. The graffiti-like splashes of color, the red rouge and blue eye shadow,
					literally 'de-faces' Mao's image - an act of rebellion against the Communist propaganda machine by
					using its own heralded image against itself. Warhol uses modernist art devices such as
					expressionistic brushstrokes around Mao's face as a further pun: the brushstrokes are a sign of
					personal expression and artistic freedom - the very ideas that Mao's Cultural Revolution was
					against.

				<h2> Oxidation Painting </h2>
				<h3> 1978 </h3>
				<p>
					Created late in Warhol's career, Oxidation Painting is part of a series of works that was produced
					by the artist alone, or with a group of his friends, and made by urinating on a canvas of copper
					paint that was placed horizontally on the floor and then allowing the result to oxidize. The result
					was a metallic sheen with a surprising depth of color and texture; a surface reminiscent of works by
					Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock. Warhol put much thought and design into these
					works, and is quoted as saying, "[these paintings] had technique, too. If I asked someone to do an
					Oxidation painting, and they just wouldn't think about it, it would just be a mess. Then I did it
					myself -- and it's just too much work -- and you try to figure out a good design."

				<h2> Rorschach </h2>
				<h3> 1984 </h3>
				<p>
					Although Warhol's earliest work declared a dramatic break with Abstract Expressionism, he remained
					interested in abstraction throughout his career, and, in 1984, focused his ideas into his large
					series of Rorschach paintings. They were inspired by the so-called Rorschach test, devised by the
					Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach. The test requires patients to say what they see in a set of
					ten standardized ink blots; in this way Rorschach believed we might gain access to unconscious
					thoughts. Warhol believed that much abstract painting functioned in a similar way: instead of
					artists being able to communicate thoughts through abstract form, as many believed, he thought that
					viewers simply projected their own ideas on to the pictures. His Rorschach pictures were therefore a
					kind of parody of abstract painting: they were mirrors which reflected the viewer's own thoughts,
					and at times they seemed to resemble genitalia or wallpaper designs.

				<h2> General Electric with Waiter </h2>
				<h3> 1984 </h3>
				<p>
					It was at the suggestion of art dealer Bruno Bischofsberger that Warhol began collaborating on
					paintings. He worked first with the Italian Francesco Clemente, and with the much younger,
					Haitian-American painter Jean-Michel Basquiat; later he produced work with Keith Haring. Warhol's
					reputation was flagging in the early 1980s, and he had painted little since the 1960s, but his
					collaboration with Basquiat, which spanned two years between 1984-5, energized him and placed him
					amidst a young and more fashionable generation. General Electric with Waiter is typical of the
					pictures the pair produced together: Warhol contributed enlarged headlines, brand names and
					fragments of advertisements; Basquiat added his expressive graffiti. The success of the series
					rested on the cartoon qualities inherent in both Pop art and graffiti.

				<h2> Self-Portrait </h2>
				<h3> 1986 </h3>
				<p>
					Warhol's self portraits that he created throughout his career reveal an underlying theme. It can be
					argued that Warhol's most successful artwork was the image of himself, invented and reinvented over
					his body of work. Simply consider the fact that Warhol started his art career as a nerdy, shy,
					balding designer and ended it as a star whose popularity could match his greatest depictions
					(Monroe, Elvis, Mao).

					In this particular work, the focus is on Warhol's head and wig (one of dozens he wore over the
					years). By using repetitive images, each slightly different to the next, and then overlapping the
					images, Warhol produces the illusion of movement. Created towards the end of his life, Self-Portrait
					displays the artist in his signature wig, and also makes dramatic use of shadow and light.

				<h2> The Last Supper </h2>
				<h3> 1986 </h3>
				<p>
					Behind Warhol's silver wig and black glasses (of Campbells Soup, Marylin, and drug/sex film fame)
					was a devout Catholic who went to mass and volunteered at homeless shelters regularly. Warhol's
					mother was a very religious woman who instilled in him a connection to the church.

					Warhol's religiosity is most exemplified by the late works that he created based on Leonardo Da
					Vinci's The Last Supper (1495–1498). Warhol based his works on a black and white photograph of a
					popular 19th century engraving and ended up producing over a hundred drawings, paintings, and
					silkscreens of the Renaissance masterpiece. From superimposing brand names over the faces of the
					apostles, to cutting up the unity of the scene, Warhol honored the original painting while adding it
					into his business enterprise.
